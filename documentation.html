      <p>
        I've loved playing Sudoku my whole life, and so it was very easy to pick
        which game I wanted to create.
      </p>
      <p>
        When thinking about how to create this game, I wanted to mimic something
        I love dearly, <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>. I designed the
        way I wrote the UI after the React API, and tried to manage game state
        using the same principles. Overall, I learned a lot and I'm fairly happy
        with how the code turned out.
      </p>
      <p>
        My code does in fact generate the entire board with JavaScript, and I
        use a small CSS style sheet to style the elements. Attaching class names
        to my elements I create with JavaScript as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each time the user clicks onto one of the squares, I replace it with an
        input box, capture the value they enter, then return it to a regular
        <code>&lt;div /&gt;</code> block element.
      </p>

      <p>
        The game data is loaded from the boards.json file in this project. It
        uses the fetch API, so it requires you use a web server so it can make
        that API call. I've included one that should work on most any modern
        laptop, you just have to run the `bin/start` script.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm also using localStorage to track the timer for the game as a
        separate component. I save the time for the current game to local
        storage every second so that when the user leaves and comes back, it
        keeps track of the time they've spent on the puzzle.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most difficult part of implementing this game was the validation
        logic to see that each number is in a valid place after the user places
        it there. I may have saved myself some time if I had thought of this up
        front, and optimized my board data structures for validation.
